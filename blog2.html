            <h2>What is Data Mining?</h2>
            <p>Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, relationships, and insights from large datasets. Often considered the cornerstone of data science, it involves using statistical and computational techniques to sift through data and extract meaningful information.</p>

            <h3>Key Characteristics of Data Mining:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify hidden patterns and relationships in historical datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Uses methods like clustering, classification, regression, and association rule mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Provides actionable insights to inform decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Common tools include Weka, RapidMiner, and SQL-based solutions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications of Data Mining:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Recommendation systems (e.g., Amazon’s “Customers also bought” feature).</li>
                <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Fraud detection through anomaly identification.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Predictive analytics for disease outbreak patterns.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to make predictions or decisions based on input data.</p>

            <h3>Key Characteristics of Machine Learning:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Build models that generalize and make predictions on unseen data.</li>
                <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Output:</strong> Predictive models or systems capable of adaptation over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Popular libraries include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications of Machine Learning:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Real-time decision-making for navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Personalized medicine recommendations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Overlaps Between Data Mining and Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>While data mining focuses on discovering existing patterns, machine learning aims to predict future outcomes. Here’s where they intersect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Dependency:</strong> Both rely heavily on high-quality data for accurate results.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Techniques like clustering and decision trees are used in both fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Improve understanding and decision-making through data analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, a retailer might use data mining to analyze past sales trends and machine learning to forecast future sales based on those insights.</p>
