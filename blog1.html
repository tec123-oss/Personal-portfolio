            <h2>What is Linear Regression?</h2>
            <p>Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to fit a linear equation to the observed data. This linear equation represents the relationship between the variables, allowing you to make predictions based on new input data.</p>

            <h2>Types of Linear Regression</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Linear Regression:</strong> This involves only one independent variable.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Linear Regression:</strong> This extends simple linear regression by using two or more independent variables.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Does Linear Regression Work?</h2>
            <p>The core idea behind linear regression is finding the "best-fit line" through the data points. This line minimizes the error between the predicted values and the actual values in the dataset. The error is typically measured by the <strong>least squares</strong> method.</p>

            <h2>Assumptions in Linear Regression</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linearity:</strong> There is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The observations are independent of each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Homoscedasticity:</strong> The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable.</li>
                <li><strong>Normality of errors:</strong> The residuals of the model are normally distributed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Evaluating the Model</h2>
            <p>The most common metrics for evaluating a linear regression model are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R-squared (RÂ²):</strong> Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).</li>
                <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</strong> Provides an estimate of the average error magnitude in the units of the dependent variable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications of Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>Linear regression is widely used in various fields such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Economics</li>
                <li>Healthcare</li>
                <li>Marketing</li>
                <li>Real Estate</li>
            </ul>

            <p id="more" style="display:none;">Linear regression is a foundational concept in data science, offering simplicity, ease of understanding, and practicality in real-world applications. Whether you're just starting your journey in data science or you're an experienced practitioner, mastering linear regression is essential for building robust predictive models. By understanding the mechanics of linear regression, you can interpret relationships between variables, make informed predictions, and take your analysis skills to the next level. As you work with more complex datasets, you'll also be ready to explore more advanced regression techniques and machine learning algorithms.</p>
